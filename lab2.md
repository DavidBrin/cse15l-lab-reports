  - The method handle request is being called to return a string from the given URL
  - The relevant argument is the URL being read that we type into the browser.
  - The values of the chat string and the counter int are the relevant field values.
     - The counter does not change, yet the chat string adds the new chats into the same string as the old chats and returns the two combined.
     - The counter remains 0, and the chat value changes to "David: hello lab\nLab: howdy partner\n"

# Part 3: reflection

This week I learned how to read information from the URL and transfer it onto the website using the given classes and libraries. I also didn't know about the remote access and the keys to forgo the password. The `mkdir` command was also helpful for quick organization.
