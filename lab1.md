  - The working directory when the command was run was /home.
  - I got this output because we gave no arguments to change the directory, therefore, nothing happened.  
  - The output is not an error.

  - The working directory when the command was run was /home and after it was run was /home/lecture1/messages
  - The output of nothing being printed yet having a new directory occurred because the command worked correctly and changed the directory to the directory given in the argument.
  - The output is not an error.

  - The working directory when the command was run was  /home/lecture1/messages.
  - The output was an error message telling us that in the command we ran (cd) the argument we gave it was not a directory.
  - The output is an error because the command needs a directory to change to and the file is not a directory.

## `ls` command
1. <img width="245" alt="image" src="https://github.com/DavidBrin/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/79377443/6a1de967-0cc0-4495-ad85-24966eb6cca3"> 
  - The working directory was /home/lecture1/messages.
  - The given output occurred because those files were all the files (and directories) available in the current working directory.
  - The output is not an error.

2. <img width="239" alt="image" src="https://github.com/DavidBrin/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/79377443/a41220d8-4dbc-4b54-91da-f188fe36caa8">
- The working directory was /home.
- The given output occurred because we added a path to a directory with those available directories/files.
- The output is not an error.

3. <img width="285" alt="image" src="https://github.com/DavidBrin/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/79377443/63281b8c-fe24-4a1b-99c7-cec3ad4c361b">
- The working directory was /home.
- The given output simply returned the path to the file because the file given is not a directory and therefore did not have files or directories to list.
- The output is not an error.

## `cat` command
1. <img width="217" alt="image" src="https://github.com/DavidBrin/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/79377443/31b1bb80-4a9d-48a4-87ee-c0511a07ca2c">
 - The working directory was /home.
 - The output was nothing because we gave the function nothing to concatenate.
 - The output is an error because it was looking for files and didn't get any so it stopped the terminal.

2. <img width="225" alt="image" src="https://github.com/DavidBrin/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/79377443/85e7e611-9698-444d-9a57-81d43b809a68">
 - The working directory was /home.
 - The output happened because the argument given was not a file that it could concatenate.
 - The output is an error because the cat command expects a file to concatenate, since it wasn't, it returned an error message. 

3. <img width="209" alt="image" src="https://github.com/DavidBrin/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/79377443/af87378c-fc60-4776-bb0b-a32d5ec424f4">
- The working directory was /home.
- The output is the printed contents of the file because that is the function of the cat command with one argument.
- The output is not an error.
