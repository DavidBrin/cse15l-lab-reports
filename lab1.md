A screenshot or Markdown code block showing the command and its output
What the working directory was when the command was run
A sentence or two explaining why you got that output (e.g. what was in the filesystem, what it meant to have no arguments).
Indicate whether the output is an error or not, and if it's an error, explain why it's an error.

## cd command

  - The working directory when the command was run was /home.
  - I got this output because we gave no arguments to change the directory, therefore, nothing happened.  
  - The output is not an error.

  - The working directory when the command was run was /home and after it was run was /home/lecture1/messages
  - The output of nothing being printed yet having a new directory occurred because the command worked correctly and changed the directory to the directory given in the argument.
  - The output is not an error.

3. <img width="308" alt="image" src="https://github.com/DavidBrin/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/79377443/5e61e061-8018-4793-af94-96d8debf4989">
  - The working directory when the command was run was  /home/lecture1/messages.
  - The output was an error message telling us that in the command we ran (cd) the argument we gave it was not a directory.
  - The output is an error because the command needs a directory to change to and the file is not a directory.

## ls command
1. <img width="245" alt="image" src="https://github.com/DavidBrin/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/79377443/6a1de967-0cc0-4495-ad85-24966eb6cca3"> 
  - The working directory was /home/lecture1/messages.
